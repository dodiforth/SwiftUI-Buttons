This is a practice for SwiftUI buttons and idea of instance as well.

I want to talk about the button View.

I thought we would take a look at creating some button instances in a fresh project together before
we go back to the war card game to use the button instances there.

In some instances, a button is a structure just like that text was.
And we need to create a button instance.

In other words, we need to instantiate a button.
Thatâ€™s just another way of saying it.

There are a couple of different initialisation methods we can use to create a button instance.

And this is a repository for practice.
